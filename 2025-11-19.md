## What are some sqlalchemy parameters for better connection handling?

pool_recycle: recycles connection before i might timeout
pool_pre_ping: tests connection before using it

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

engine = create_engine(
  pool_size=10, # Minimum number of connections to keep open inside the connection pool
  max_overflow=20, # Maximum number of connections to open above pool_size
  pool_timeout=30, # Maximum time to wait for a connection 
  pool_recycle=300, #Recycles connections after this many seconds
  pool_pre_ping=True, # Tests connection before using it

)

```
